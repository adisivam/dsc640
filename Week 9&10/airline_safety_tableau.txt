Is

mean
of
transportation?

Though
it
sounds
like
airline
travel
is
unsafe
it
is
in
fact
still
one
of
the
safest
modes
of
transportation
The
chart
shows
the
total
number
of
passenger
flight
accidents
and
fatalities
by
aircrafts
for
every
100K
miles
flown
over
the
years
The
numbers
are
not
only
low
for
the
recent
years
but
the
trend
has
significantly
dropped
since
1995
There
are
more
statistical
data
to
prove
that
air
travel
fatality
rate
has
been
decreased
substantially

The
graph
shown
in
figure

shows
the
number
of
incidents
and
fatal
accidents
over
two
time
periods
the
1985-99
time
period
and
the
2000-14
time
period
From
the
graph
we
see
the
number
of
accidents
has
been
declined
by
57%
in
2000-14
period
as
compared
to
1985-99

The
fatal
accident
has
also
been
decreased
by
23%
in
the
recent
timeframe
compared
to
the
previous
timeframe
where
it
was
32%
